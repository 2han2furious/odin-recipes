            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Learning the right techniques to flambe your food can turn an ordinary meal, savory or sweet, into an unforgettable dish. From the French term for "flamed," "to flambé" means to add alcohol to the preparation so it bursts into flame. This process partially burns the alcohol content but keeps the wonderful flavor of the alcohol used. Although many people think that alcohol is burned in its entirety, flambé dishes shouldn't be served to pregnant women, kids, or people who abstain from alcohol.</p>
